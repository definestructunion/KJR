#### Khys Java Roguelike

KJR is a simple, crossplatform, performant framework for creating tiled roguelike games.

# Core Features

- Rendering

# Planned features
- Z axis rendering

# Why KJR Over More Popular Libraries?

While libraries such as libGDX and jMonkeyEngine may have many more features, many of them will not be
used in a typical roguelike game, and often slows down the game as a result.

KJR is licenced under the LGPL as it uses OpenAL.
