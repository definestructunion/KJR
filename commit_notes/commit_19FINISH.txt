1: Added Features
    - XComp
        - A GUI component
    - XConsole
        - Defines a colour theme and an area to add XComps
    - Align
        - Helps to align XComps to XConsoles

Very primitive GUI features have been added

Variable naming convention will change from snake_case to camelCase

I believe that is all.
