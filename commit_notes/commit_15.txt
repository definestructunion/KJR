Commit 15:

1: Updated README.md
    - created category "Maybe features"
        - designed for features of low priority and may not be Added
    - removed "Config class" from planned features - no longer planned
    - added "Config class" to Maybe features

2: Removed Features
    - SpriteBatch
        - removed all uses of Vec4 and replaced it with Colour, making performance moderately better

3: Added Features
    - Colour
        - represents both an rgba and hex value
        - no longer have to perform calculations every submission to convert
          rgba to hex

I believe that is all.
