Commit 10:

1: Added Features
	- TileRenderer
		- Is still a bit of a mess and probably buggy, will fix 		  later
	- Asset Management
		- Adding either texture, audio, or font to the 		  appropriate asset manager will automatically
		  delete the asset once game closes, meaning the user
		  doesn't have to explicitely call it

2: Edited README.md
	- Removed "Z axis rendering" from Planned features - finished
	- Added "Clean up renderer code" to Todo

I believe that is all.
