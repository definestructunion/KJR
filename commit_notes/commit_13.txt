Commit 13:

1: Removed Features:
    - LayerBatch
        - LayerBatch is no longer needed as it has been merged over to SpriteBatch while retaining the same functionality

2: Added Features:
    - SpriteBatch
        - added layering functionality where the layer coordinate (z) is much more flexible now as it works with floats
          and depends on the bound shader's near and far values
    - Build Folder
        - deleted previous build_unknown build
        - added build_13 to build

I believe that is all.
