Commit 7:

1: Edited README.md
	- Removed "Update default shader" from Todo - finished
	- Removed "Text scaling" from Planned features - finished
	- Removed " as it uses OpenAL." from License - useless
	- Added   "." to license - punctuation

2: Code Updates
	- Updated shader class
	- Added text scaling
	- Removed all remnants of my heretical notation (hungarian) and
	  brace style
	- Moved all Main.java code into TestGame.java
	- Abstracted shaders from user more
	- Removed unneeded file (forgot name)

I believe that is all.
