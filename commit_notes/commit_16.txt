Commit 16:

Added Features:
    - Glyph
        - represents basic characteristics of a bitmap font glyph
    - BFont (Bitmap Font)
        - represents a font made from a bitmap
        - limited in how it can be made
            - requires 32 glyphs prior to starting at 0x0020 (UTF-16)
            - after which, you need all the characters from space to tilde
              after tilde, you can have as many characters as you want, but must be
              accessed by index rather than by char
    - SpriteBatch
        - added debug functions for printing glyphs and glyph texts

I believe that is all.
